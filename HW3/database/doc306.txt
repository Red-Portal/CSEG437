samsung mobile devices use ipad and iphone chips, analyst claims

After the WWDC keynote, the mobile industry plot thickens on reports this morning claiming samsung is fielding exactly the same arm-based processor as apple does inside its new crop of mobile devices. 
We learned last week that samsung is making a tablet based on the same processor as used within the iphone, but we hadn't been told it was an exact copy of the processor.
The samsung tablet is a larger version of the samsung galaxy smartphone, and is going to run the android os. It will be called the galaxy tab.

apple has spent ample time discussing the benefits of the 1GHz A4 processor used in its new ios devices.It even gets a nod in the latest Apple iphone 4 video (below). Indeed, Apple has invested widely in processor technology as it builds out its range of ios-powered devices.

In April, iFixit took a close look at the ipad's A4 processor. It claimed the A4's system on chip (soc) has three different dies with two of those layers containing samsung memory for a total 256mb memory. 

The arm reference design used was identified as the arm Cortex A8. For future iphone 4 owners, of course, the ability of this chip to push out 720p video playback is just part of the reason the iphone 4 has such fantastic video features, and a spectacular screen to match.
