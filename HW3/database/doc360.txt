a mobile phone (also called mobile, cellular telephone, cell phone or handphone[1]) is an electronic device used for full duplex two-way radio telecommunications over a cellular network of base stations known as cell sites. mobile phones differ from cordless telephones, which only offer telephone service within limited range through a single base station attached to a fixed land line, for example within a home or an office.
