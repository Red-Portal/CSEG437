a smartphone is a mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary basic feature phone.[2] smartphones and feature phones may be thought of as handheld computers integrated within a mobile telephone, but while most feature phones are able to run applications based on platforms such as java me,[3] a smartphone allows the user to install and run more advanced applications based on a specific platform. smartphones run complete operating system software providing a platform for application developers.[4] so nowadays we can consider a smartphone as a personal pocket computer (ppc) with mobile phone functions, because these devices are mainly computers, although smaller ones than a desktop computer (dc). additionally a ppc (personal pocket computer) is more personal than a dc (desktop computer).
