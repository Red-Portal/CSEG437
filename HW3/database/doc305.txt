samsung's new wireless usb chipset enables hd streaming with less power

It's a beautiful combination, really -- lower power consumption, and support for high bandwidth applications. That marriage is evident in samsung's newest wireless usb chipset, which was built around ultra wide band (uwb) technology and designed to enable high-def streaming between a mobile host device and a tethered device for viewing. According to Sammy, the two-chip solution will be aimed at cameras, camcorders, TVs, PCs, tablets, beam projectors, portable HDDs, Blu-ray players and handsets, and given that it can handle a theoretical high of 480Mbps with an average power consumption of less than 300mW, even the weakest smartphone battery should be able to stream at least a single episode of Family Guy to the tele. Mum's the word on who all will be lining up to adopt this stuff, but since it's slated to hit mass production in Q4, we'd say those details should be worked out right around ces 2011.
