Nintendo Software Technology Corporation (NST) is an American-based first-party developer for the Japanese video game corporation Nintendo. NST was created to specifically create games for Nintendo consoles for the North American market. Although Claude Comair (co-founder of DigiPen) was co-founder of NST, he retired from his post as chairman at the end of 2006. NST is currently headed by Shigeki Yamashiro. Their first game, Bionic Commando Elite Forces, was released for the Game Boy Color in 1999 and was a sequel of Capcom's Bionic Commando.
