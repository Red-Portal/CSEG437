Destiny 2 Trailer Censored Xbox Controller for PlayStation Players


Xbox and PlayStation are the two biggest names in gaming today and the battle between the brand¡¯s respective fan bases is a big part of the gaming community. 

While, despite their rivalry, both companies generally try to maintain a level of civility, every so often a story surfaces that shows the tug-of-war between the two is alive and well. 

Today, one of those stories came to light, this time surrounding the trailer for the new Destiny 2 expansion Forsaken.

As spotted by one eagle-eyed Reddit user today, Sony has seemingly censored an Xbox One controller seen in the trailer for Forsaken. 

Currently, the trailer released during the recent Bungie livesteam, which showed off all the new content coming to Destiny 2, is available on the official YouTube channels for PlayStation, Xbox, and Bungie, though the video uploaded to the PlayStation channel is ever so slightly different.
