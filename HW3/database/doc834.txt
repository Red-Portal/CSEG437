Abstract
Fall prevention is a critical component of health care; falls are a common source of injury in the elderly and are associated
with significant levels of mortality and morbidity. Automatically detecting falls can allow rapid response to potential
emergencies; in addition, knowing the cause or manner of a fall can be beneficial for prevention studies or a more tailored
emergency response. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate techniques to not only reliably detect a fall but also to
automatically classify the type. We asked 15 subjects to simulate four different types of falls–left and right lateral, forward
trips, and backward slips–while wearing mobile phones and previously validated, dedicated accelerometers. Nine subjects
also wore the devices for ten days, to provide data for comparison with the simulated falls. We applied five machine
learning classifiers to a large time-series feature set to detect falls. Support vector machines and regularized logistic
regression were able to identify a fall with 98% accuracy and classify the type of fall with 99% accuracy. This work
demonstrates how current machine learning approaches can simplify data collection for prevention in fall-related research
as well as improve rapid response to potential injuries due to falls.

Introduction
Falls in the elderly are a relatively common occurrence that can
have dramatic health consequences. For people over 75 years old,
the estimated incidence of falls is over 30 percent per year [1].
Nearly half of nursing home residents fall each year, with 40%
falling more than once [2]. Falls can cause physical injury
including fractures, head injuries, or serious lacerations. In
community-dwelling patients who have fallen in a given year,
the rate of serious injury is 5–10% [3,4]. Falls can also elicit
psychological consequences such as decreased independence [5]
and increased fear of falling [6,7]. This can lead to an avoidance of
activity that can bring about a pattern of increasing isolation and
deterioration [8,9]. The impact of falls can be dramatic on certain
populations, motivating the search for improved methods to
minimize and respond to falls.
There are a number of strategies used to minimize falls [10].
There are physical training strategies such strength training [11]
and balance training [12]. Modifying the home or workplace
decreases the chance of falling [13]. The number of falls can be
decreased by optimizing medication [14] or even having patients
take nutritional supplements such as Vitamin D [15]. There are
many therapies, medications, and lifestyle changes that can
influence the probability of falling; however, at this time more
research needs to be conducted. Improving the ability to track falls
has the potential to streamline a wide range of fall-related
research.
One objective and convenient way of documenting patient falls
is through the use of mobile phones; most smart phones are
equipped with accelerometers that can be used to detect when
patients fall with exceptionally high accuracy. Falls are generally
high-impact events, making detection simpler than identifying
other daily activities. For example, some previous fall detection
algorithms used only thresholds for the low freefall accelerations
followed by high impact accelerations [16,17]. Unfortunately,
these studies either have very limited data sets (e.g. 3 young
volunteers in very limited control circumstances) [16] or lower
accuracy rates of nearly 80% for mobile phones [17]. Additional
studies have simply observed the variations in a number of features
[18]. Here we will apply a larger number of features, as has been
done in previous studies using linear regression to predict falls
[19], but use classifiers that have been successfully applied in
activity recognition for mobile phones [20].
We use these classifiers to not only detect falls, but also to
classify the particular type of fall. For example, in prosthetics
research, adjusting aspects of a knee joint is often a tradeoff
between which type of fall will occur. Different types of falls can
result in different types of injuries. In the elderly a slip may be
more or less likely to result in a serious injury than a trip simply
because of the ease of breaking a forward versus backward fall.
Also, because people tend to be more stable laterally, it is more
likely when given a lateral fall that it may be from a loss of
consciousness. Knowing the type of fall can be important for

coordinating a more appropriate response to the fall, or adjusting
the treatment to prevent a similar type of fall in the future.
The main focus of our study is to not only identify falls, but also
classify their type. We can accomplish very high accuracy by using
a much larger feature set than previous methods and by using
current machine learning approaches to deal with the large
number of resulting features. We demonstrate classification by
having subjects simulate the different types of falls and record the
resulting accelerations. For analyzing the ability to detect falls,
these recordings are compared to fall-like events taken from a large
dataset of everyday movements. Importantly, we show that our
features and classifiers are capable of detecting and classifying the
type of fall with a much higher level of accuracy than current
techniques.
Results
To create and validate the machine learning approaches for fall
detection and classification, we collected two data sets. Fall data
was obtained by simulating four different types of falls, representing
four different directions in which someone could fall (slipbackward,
trip-forward, left/right lateral – figure 1a) while subjects
wore accelerometers on a belt, as detailed in the methods. Subjects
also wore the accelerometers during everyday activities for a week,
which measured a range of accelerations that could potentially be
misclassified as false-positives. We applied five different machine
learning classifiers to perform both the detection and the fall-type
classification.
We collected the accelerometer data in a standardized way.
Both a mobile phone and a separate, dedicated accelerometer
were attached on belts and placed on the back of subjects. For
simplicity, analysis is only shown and discussed for the mobile
phone accelerometer. We found that the use of dedicated
accelerometers provided comparable results to those presented
for the mobile phone – although we note a possible ceiling effect as
other classification strategies have shown significant improvements
using dedicated accelerometers [17]. The orientation of the phone
determined the orientation of the accelerometer axes. Because of
the orientation of the phone on the belt, the x, y, and z-axes of the
accelerometer corresponded to the up, left, and backward
directions on the subjects (fig 1b and c). This setup was used to
record from subjects for the four classes of simulated falls, as well
as collecting recordings when the subjects wore the belts for a
week. The goal of recording the data in this standardized way was
to make interpretation clearer and analysis more accurate.
We expected the different falls to have characteristic signatures
in the recorded movements. For example, if someone falls forward,
the z-axis would be oriented in the same direction as gravity at
impact and likely after the fall. This regularity is evident in our
displayed fall samples (fig 2a). However, not all falls could be
classified that simplistically. Instead of searching for particular,
directly observable features (e.g. high-impact accelerations), we
chose to apply the standard, state-of-the-art machine learning
approach: we constructed a large feature set (see methods) and had
the algorithms select how to combine and weigh them appropriately.
We then needed data to evaluate our ability to detect falls. For
this we selected samples of non-fall activities that were from
everyday experience. Previous studies had subjects reenact
activities of everyday living, such as sitting onto objects or walking
[16], however, we decided to obtain a more natural and
potentially more challenging control sample. By having the
subjects wear the phones for a week, we collected a number of
potential misclassification events. We selected the samples that
were most fall-like based on the overall change in acceleration over
a short, two-second interval. The selected average rate for these
events was one per hour of recording. Although some samples
appeared periodic in nature, many appeared similar to the
simulated falls (fig 2b). Based on observations of these fall-like
events, we believe these samples provided a better control group
for fall detection than simulated daily activities.
We first wanted to know how well the system could distinguish
between the four different types of falls. We used five different
classifiers: support vector machines (SVM), sparse multinomial
logistic regression (SMLR, also referred to as regularized logistic
regression), Naı¨ve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees.
We used the standard time series features as detailed in table 1.
Using 10-fold cross-validation, SVM and SMLR classifiers were
able to achieve 99% accuracy (SVM shown in figure 3a). To
consider how well these classifiers would generalize to subjects for
which there is no training data, we also performed subject-wise
crossvalidation which only decreased the accuracy for SVM
classification by 0.5% (figure 3b). In effect, both techniques had
near perfect classification of the type of fall based on mobile phone
accelerometer data.
We also wanted to know how well the system could distinguish
fall-like events in everyday life from actual, simulated falls.
Importantly, the fall-like events were selected based on the
highest-impact events from a set of eight week-long recordings.
Both the SVM and SMLR classifiers achieved accuracies near
98% for pooled subject data when using 10-fold crossvalidation,
while that accuracy decreased to only 97% when subject-wise
crossvalidation was used. (fig 3c,d). In other words, across an
average week of everyday movements there would be an estimated
2–3 non-falls that would be misclassified as falls. The combination
of standard time-series feature sets and modern classifiers was able
to detect falls with a high degree of accuracy.
We also wanted to demonstrate the efficacy of modern machine
learning classifiers compared to more standard classifiers. Both
SVM and SMLR are known to perform well with a large number
of features. We wanted to contrast these with three more
traditional classifiers (fig 4). Both decision trees and k-nearest
neighbors performed at 94–98% accuracy for fall detection and
98–99% for fall type classification. Naı¨ve Bayes performed poorly
in both fall detection (63%–66%) and fall classification (88–90%)
which can be expected because of the large number of potentially
irrelevant features in our approach. Although all classifiers except
Naı¨ve Bayes report relatively high accuracies, SVM and SMLR
classifiers are most accurate over all crossvalidation methods used,
providing 98% accuracy for fall detection and 99% accuracy for
fall classification.
Discussion
We sought to use mobile phones and standard state-of-the-art
machine learning to perform robust fall detection and classification.
Instead of hand-picking the most relevant features, we used a
large feature set, and had the relevant features selected by the
algorithms. By applying classifiers such as SVM and SMLR, we
showed that either popular technique performs well when large
feature sets can be used, with near perfect accuracies in all cases.
This was possible with the standard basic acceleration sensors
found in almost all modern smartphones and could thus be
implemented in phone apps.
Mobile phones are a convenient platform for recording
movements, particularly measuring falls. They have built-in
communication protocols that allow simple data logging to the
device and wireless transmission. This permits real-time response

or, in an experimental setting, compliance verification. Because
mobile phones are widely adopted, compliance without verification
is already high, as people are used to carrying them. Also,
price is significantly reduced due to high production volume. Due
to these advantages, mobile phones have the promise to provide a
convenient, inexpensive, and objective means to track falls.
Previous work has shown how the accelerometers in mobile
phones can be used to classify activities, including falls. Activities
such as sitting, standing, walking, and running can be identified
from mobile phone accelerations [21,22,23,24,25]. Our use of
SVM’s is also supported by work showing activity recognition and
fall detection that can be over 95% accurate in both cases [20];
however, that work was done analyzing the movement of body
position based on radio tags. Our experimental design is most
similar to that of Lee and Carlisle [17] (e.g. simulated falls, phones
and dedicated accelerometers) although their accuracy was
approximately 80%. This was primarily a result of using a simple
threshold-based classification strategy relying primarily on the
maximum and minimum accelerations to detect a fall. By
comparison, we appear to be getting a lot of mileage out of using
these machine learning algorithms. Tolkiehn and colleagues [26]
used a chest mounted accelerometer with a small feature set to
obtain 84% detection accuracy. Uniquely, they also classified
direction of fall with 94% accuracy. All of these previous fall
detection and classification approaches either used smaller feature
sets or simpler classification methods. We believe our work shows
that the use of mobile phones for fall detection can be greatly
improved when using modern machine learning strategies.
Although this study presents high accuracies, there are a
number of issues that will still need to be addressed before such
techniques could be used in a more applied setting. First, the
mobile phones used here were placed in a standardized position.
This allowed highly stereotypical measurements that aided
accuracy ratings, but made the results less applicable to the way
people carry their mobile phones every day – e.g. a smartphone in
a pocket will certainly lead to lower accuracies due to the
inconsistent ways it can be carried. Also, the fall-like events from
the week-long recordings, though perhaps better than using
certain simulated daily activities, may not have provided an
adequate control data set. There is no guarantee that the fall-like
events selected are a representative sample of potential misclassifications.
This false-positive rate would have to be more directly

assessed to consider viability for application. Although this result
relies on standardized accelerometer positioning, and false positive
rates for daily living were not fully explored, this does demonstrate
a significant improvement in current fall detection and classification
techniques.
Fall detection promises to be important in the context of
healthcare. The impact on individuals has already been addressed
in the introduction, but the injuries, psychological damage, and
increased patterns of inactivity due to falls will also be an
increasing burden to health care services [27]. Over time this
burden is expected to increase dramatically; currently there are
approximately 40 million people over age 65, and this number is
expected to reach 86.7 million in 2050 [28]. Most dramatically,
the number of people aged 85 or older, the age most likely to suffer
health consequences from a fall, is expected to triple by 2050. For
this reason, there is an increasing incentive for the health care
industry to pursue methods to minimize the number of falls,
decrease the type of falls that are more likely to cause injury, and
improve emergency response when falls do occur. We believe that
any work that facilitates research addressing this issue can impact
populations prone to falls, but also the health care infrastructure
tasked to care for them.
This work is motivated by the possibility of using the fall
detection algorithms in real-world scenarios where patients only

have to carry phones with the downloaded app installed. This
possibility depends on alleviating two critical, practical concerns –
maximizing battery life and minimizing the number of false
positives. On T-mobile G1’s running android version 1.6 we were
able to record directly to memory for approximately 10 hours
without recharging depending on the quality of the battery and
amount of movement. This is impractical for normal, daily use.
Systems such as iFall [29] and PerFallD [30] applied techniques
such as variable sampling rates, background services, simplified
processing, and minimizing power-intensive features like screen
use and access to storage. With these adjustments, and by using
newer phones, the apps were able to run in the background over
the course of a day. An additional practical concern is how the
application responds to a potential fall during the day. For
example, after a fall, a person may not be able to respond but may
still require medical attention. The previously mentioned applications
[29,30] were able to detect when a fall occurs and respond
appropriately, however with those algorithms the rate of falsepositives
may have been a significant issue. If a potential fall is
detected, you may want to ask the user to respond; if they don’t
respond you may send a message to personal emergency contacts;
and if no action is taken by anyone, emergency first responders
could be contacted. The number of times each of these
interventions occurs should be minimized; otherwise the application
may not only be impractical from the user’s perspective, but
also too costly. By applying the techniques used here, along with
improvements in battery management, we believe that fall
detection comes one step closer to improving the immediate
medical responsiveness after individuals with disabilities fall.
The methods we applied for fall detection and classification are
important tools for improving patient outcomes from fall-related
research. It is clear that mobile phones can be used for fall
detection based on the mobile phone accelerometer readings that
were used to acquire the data here. In one sense, the feature
selection is actually simpler in this paper because it is automated –
so a large feature set can be applied. This advances the application
of modern machine learning classifiers such as support vector
machines and regularized logistic regression. The rich features sets
and state of the art machine learning classifiers are simple and
straightforward to use in practice. Based on the high accuracies
reported here for both fall detection and classification, we believe
that these tools should be considered when addressing the ability
to automatically detect falls. Such improvements have the
possibility to impact not only fall-related research studies, but
may also someday enable practical emergency responsiveness for
fall related trauma.
Methods
15 Healthy subjects (8F/7M, ages 22–50) carried recording
devices as they performed a series of simulated falls in the lab.
Nine subjects also carried the devices for a week to record
everyday behavior for later fall detection. Subjects wore a belt that
held two accelerometers – one as part of an android mobile phone,
and the other a special USB accelerometer. The phones were Tmobile
G1 phones running the Android OS version 1.6. The
sampling rate was variable between 15 and 25 Hz depending
upon the amount of movement [31]. The dedicated USB
accelerometers (Gulf Coast Data Concepts X6-2 Mini) sampled
at a constant rate of 20 Hz. These accelerometers were attached
together on a belt and centered in the back. The phone was
positioned such that the accelerometer x, y, and z axes were
directed up, left, and behind the subject, respectively (see fig 1).
Written, informed consent was obtained for all subjects. The
Northwestern University institutional review board specifically
approved this study.
Simulated falls and fall-like events
The subjects that performed simulated falls were instructed to
perform four different classes of falls – slips, trips, left lateral, and
right lateral falls. In all cases, subjects were asked to approximate
the fall type and fell onto pads. The original design separated
lateral falls into two types, active falls and faints. These two
different types of falls were combined to simplify analysis. Each
subject was instructed to perform each fall type three times for a
total of 18 times per subject.
In order to record data for fall detection analysis, nine subjects
also carried the accelerometers for one week. From these
recordings, samples of ‘‘fall-like’’ events were extracted to compare
to the data from simulated falls. Fall-like events were times in
which the acceleration changed drastically in a short period of
time. Due to battery use, only portions of the week were recorded.
Specifically, the average squared change in acceleration was
smoothed using a two second running average. 10 seconds clips
were taken at the maximum values of this function. For every hour
of recording, one sample was extracted.
Data preprocessing and feature extraction
The accelerometer signals were preprocessed using the following
procedure. The phone accelerometer values were linearly
interpolated to match 20 Hz. All analysis was performed on
10 second clips of data centered on the falls, or fall-like events in
the case of week-long recordings. From these 10 second clips,
features were extracted, as summarized in table 1. This feature set
was used for both classification tasks: detecting falls vs. non-falls
and classifying the particular type of fall.
Classification algorithm
Five different classification algorithms were used for detection
and classification: support vector machines (SVM) [32], sparse
multinomial logistic regression (SMLR) [33], naı¨ve Bayes, decision
trees, and k-nearest neighbors. Many of these techniques have
been successfully applied in a large number of machine learning
classification problems with a great deal of practical success on
large feature sets. We normalized each feature to have mean 0 and
unit variance. The SVM classifier was from the LIBSVM package

[32]. We applied radial basis functions, giving us two hyperparameters
– the soft slack variable, C, and the size of the Gaussian
kernel, c. The accuracy was highly robust to small changes in the
hyperparameters, so reasonable choices were obtained by a grid
search of 10x where x is an integer between -5 and 5. The values
which gave the highest 10-fold cross-validation accuracy are
reported (C = 10 and c = 0.1). The logistic regression classifier
(SMLR) used regularization (hence, ‘‘sparse’’) by including a
penalization term on coefficient weights. In effect, regularization is
an automatic way of performing feature selection, which helps
avoid overfitting, and greatly improves crossvalidation accuracy.
By changing the coefficient on the penalization term, l, the system
is biased to use more or fewer features. The parameter, l, was
found in the same way as the hyperparameters for SVM, giving
l = 0.0001). k-nearest neighbors only require a hyperparameter ‘k’
for the number of neighbors to average from. In this case, k = 3
was found to maximize the 10-fold crossvalidation accuracy. Naı¨ve
Bayes and decision trees had no hyperparameters. We used the
standard MATLAB implementation for the last three classifiers
(NaiveBayes, classregtree, knnclassify).
