Microsoft Store Expands Gifting to All Xbox One, PC Games

In November last year, Microsoft decided to join the 21st century by introducing Xbox One gifting options to the Microsoft Store. Rather than only being able to give gift cards, select Xbox One digital games and DLC, Xbox Live Gold, and Xbox Game Pass subscriptions could also be gifted. Seven months on, and Microsoft is expanding gifting even further.

Posting on Xbox Wire, John Smith, Senior Director, Microsoft Store Product Marketing, explains that the new gift options introduced last year have been a "huge hit." Because of that, it will now be possible to gift PC games and DLC on the Microsoft Store. The "select Xbox One games" gifting limitation is also being relaxed to include all Xbox One digital games going forward.

Sending someone a game gift can be done using Windows 10, any Xbox One, or in a web browser. All you need is a person's email address to send them a gift, or if on Xbox, you can select them by their Gamertag. The gift will be sent as a code, which can be redeemed by clicking a button. Simple!

There are a few limits on gifting worth noting. You can't buy more than two discounted products at once, or more than 10 total discounted products within a 14 day period. The only time this could ever be a problem is if Microsoft runs a mega holiday sale and you want a lot of games from it while the prices are lower. You can't gift Xbox 360 and Xbox original games, pre-orders, os associated content, and gifts can only be redeemed in the same region or country they were purchased in.

The expanding gifting options are already available to use, so go mad sending your friends and family new games to play this weekend.
