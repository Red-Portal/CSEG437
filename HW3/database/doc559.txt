Cheaters Get Thrown Out Of Battle.Net. The Battle.net online service now features 350,000 less cheaters, Blizzard recently announced. The Diablo maker took its time and escorted out everyone caught hackhanded.According to Blizzard, the banned accounts were either StarCraft or Diablo II, but they managed to have something in common: the users employed third-party hacks to make their life easier while competing against others.The bad news for honest players is that the banned accounts will become accessible once again in 30 days. But that's strike one and Blizzard promises that strike two will also mean ¡°you're out! Permanently!¡±¡°The Diablo II CD keys associated with the closed Diablo II accounts are now restricted from playing on Battle.net for approximately 30 days. Repeat offenders will have their accounts closed and their CD keys permanently banned from Battle.net.As a reminder, we reserve the right to close the accounts and ban the CD keys of players who are caught cheating on Battle.net. Cheating ruins the game experience for legitimate players, and we will not tolerate it.¡±And now, a word for the banned cheaters: guys, will you learn your lesson this time or will Blizzard have to sell you new games with new (and unbanned) CD keys?
