Looks Like Xiaomi Mi 7 Will Have An In-Display Fingerprint Sensor

It looks like Xiaomi might be the next smartphone maker to embrace in-display fingerprint scanning technology.Looks Like Xiaomi Mi 7 Will Have an In-Display Fingerprint Sensor

The news comes straight from the company’s CEO, Lei Jun; the question is whether he should be taken seriously in this case. Responding to another user’s comment on the social media platform Weibo, Lei Jun said that the forthcoming Mi 7 smartphone will feature a fingerprint scanner under its screen. But the exchange was so lighthearted in tone that it’s unclear whether his statement should be taken at face value.

Still, as Gadgets 360 notes, the development arrives after a report from about a month ago in which an anonymous tipster also claimed the Mi 7 will feature an in-display fingerprint scanner. And given that other major smartphone makers including Vivo and Huawei have recently championed in-display technology with pioneering new devices, there is strong incentive for Xiaomi to compete on this front.

It’s also worth noting that Fingerprint Cards provided the under-glass fingerprint sensor for last year’s Mi 6 smartphone, and announced that it had developed in-display technology last autumn. That technology hasn’t yet been realized in a commercially launched smartphone, but it now appears very possible that the Xiaomi Mi 7 could be the first.
