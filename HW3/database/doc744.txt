Corona SDK

Corona SDK is a cross-platform 2D game development kit used for games development for mobile platforms as well as Apple TV & Android TV. 
It uses Lua as its scripting language which is popular among game developers because of a short learning curve. 
Corona SDK is available for Mac as well as Windows operating systems. 
It comes with over 500 APIs for a range of functions from animations to networking. 
With real-time testing in Corona, you can easily ideate, code and validate in one go.
Another major perk of using Corona for mobile game development is its pricing. 
With a free plan Corona has attracted many developers and in turn, has created a huge support community. 
While the basic version is free, it also comes with an enterprise solution costing $79/month, and another version priced a little higher at $199/month. 
One downside with Corona is that it can only be used for 2D game development. It has limited to no capabilities in 3D gaming, VR or AR. 
If you are planning to create an AAA game then this platform might feel a little limiting.
