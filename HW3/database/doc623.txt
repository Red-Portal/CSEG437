Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition manages the magical trick of compressing the latest Final Fantasy epic into a mobile-friendly episodic RPG that captures much of the game¡¯s core story and charm while cutting down on the tedious JRPG grind.

The Pocket Edition deftly handles the transition from console RPG to touch screen, trading photo-realism for cute ¡°chibi¡±-style graphics, while still catching many of the same story beats and combat complexities. 

The game has its first chapter available for free, with other chapters available either as individual in-app purchases or in a bundle.
