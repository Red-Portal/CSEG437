Learn About the Type of Wireless Products that Sony's PS3 Supports

A Sony PlayStation 3 video game console isn't useful only for gaming. 
With some software on your computer and a few settings changes, you can stream music and videos from your computer to your PS3 over your home network, as well as participate in the world of online gaming. 
Many of the most popular games for the console operate entirely over online game servers. Other games usually have an online option. 
To participate, you need a connection to your home network to reach the internet. 
It can be either a wired Ethernet connection or a wireless connection. 
All PS3 consoles can be connected with an Ethernet cable to the internet, but a wireless connection is more convenient for gaming.

PS3 Wireless Capability

With the exception of the original 20GB model, the PlayStation 3 video game consoles, the PS3 Slim consoles, and the PS3 Super Slim units all include built-in 802.11g (802.11b/g) Wi-Fi wireless networking.
 You don't need to purchase a separate wireless game adapter to hook up a PS3 to a wireless home network.

The PS3 doesn't support the newer Wireless n (802.11n) form of Wi-Fi that is included in PlayStation 4 consoles.

PS3 vs. Xbox Networking Support
The PS3 networking capability is better than that of the Xbox 360, which offers no built-in wireless networking at all.
The Xbox has a built-in 10/100 Ethernet network adapter, but a wireless connection requires an 802.11n or 802.11g adapter that must be purchased separately.
