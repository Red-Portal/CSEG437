The construction of a game theme park is emerging as a viable option to make the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics more lucrative. In many cases, host cities tend to remain in the red for some time after Winter Olympic Games are over. However, Pyeongchang is intending not to go the way of them by building a theme park which combines winter sports with games and making better use of the lodging facilities and tourist resorts in the vicinity as well as the stadiums.

The Korean city¡¯s benchmark models include the Sega Joypolis and Tom¡¯s World, two of the biggest tourist attractions of Japan. The former, in particular, is highly popular with sightseers around the world for the various games available there and many interesting things to see, including the game park. At the site, Nintendo provides ski games for its Wii game console and TrustMaster offers a realistic experience by means of real winter sports gears and diverse technologies to immerse users in the games to the full.

Sega also steps up its sport marketing at every Olympics, releasing its official sports games. ¡¡¡°Enterprises¡¯ sponsorship for Winter Olympic Games tends to be smaller in size than that for Summer Games and this is why it¡¯s more difficult for the former to have a surplus,¡± said the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA), adding, ¡°However, if such a theme park is built around the venue in Pyeongchang, not only will it help make the occasion more profitable but also will redound to the arcade game industry of the country.¡±
