Apple has ramped up production of its new 7-nanometer processor for its upcoming crop of iPhones.
The new processor will be smaller, faster and more efficient than the 10nm processor in Apple's current iPhone line, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with matter.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, one of Apple's partners, has begun mass production of the chip, which is expected to be called the "A12," according to the report.
TSMC earlier this year announced that it had begun producing 7nm chips, but it didn't reveal at that time for whom it was producing the silicon, Bloomberg noted.
It is very likely that Apple has began mass producing 7nm chips, said Charles King, principal analyst atÂ Pund-IT.
"The move to 7nm silicon was one of the reasons Apple shifted an increasing amount of business to TSMC and away from Samsung," he told TechNewsWorld.
"Assuming that chip yields can support Apple's manufacturing needs, I expect we'll see iPhones with the new chips later this year," King added.
