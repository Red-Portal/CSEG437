It¡¯s hard to believe it¡¯s already been two years since we launched Uncharted 4 on May 10, 2016. 

Despite the time that has passed, we still see such amazing love and support for the game and Uncharted series through your social media comments, fan art submissions, Photo Mode creations, cosplay photos, and gameplay clips week after week. 

We are truly fortunate to have such an incredible Uncharted community.

As a small gesture of our thanks, to celebrate the anniversary of Uncharted 4, today we¡¯ve launched a new set of Uncharted 4: A Thief¡¯s End Stickers for Apple devices and a new Uncharted 10th Anniversary Theme for PlayStation 4.
