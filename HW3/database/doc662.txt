Google just boasted about a new tool called Seurat which is named after the great French painter and designed to make high-end film-quality 3D scenes playable on mobile devices.
To show off the technology, Google collaborated with Lucasfilm's ILMxLAB. They took a high-fidelity digital set from Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, compressed the polygons — from over 50 million down to 72,000 — and textures then ran it through a prototype WorldSense headset in real time. By contrast, the scene takes hours per frame for the computer to render. Seurat just takes 13 milliseconds.
The scene, which featured a dark Imperial Hangar, incorporated real-time reflections and sophisticated lighting effects, in addition to an animated K-2SO included in the demo. Reports say it wasn't as visually compelling as watching it inside the cinema, but it's heaps better than what you'd typically see on mobile hardware.
What's more, it's quite impressive that the entire rendering process is being handled by specs with less power than a dedicated computer for rendering, especially if you take into account that these 3D scenes typically can't be accessible, or better yet — "consumable" — in real-time. What takes hours and hours for computers to create, you can jump into and explore as if you're there.
