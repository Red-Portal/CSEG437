Mobile Messaging with Microsoft Office Outlook Mobile

Outlook Mobile now offers you a vastly superior mobile messaging experience. The familiar Microsoft Outlook tools, plus support for Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint attachments help you be more productive while away from your desk. 
You can sync most Windows Mobile powered devices over-the-air, through your mobile operator or at a wireless hotspot. Your Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks are always up to date. You can also sync when you¡¯re back at your desk. 

With the new Messaging and Security Feature pack, available on some new devices, you¡¯ll get Direct Push technology. This means you¡¯ll never have to wait for your e-mail. Moments after your messages have been sent, they¡¯ll arrive in your hand.
