application software, also known as an application, or an app, is computer software designed to help the user to perform singular or multiple related specific tasks. examples include enterprise software, accounting software, office suites, graphics software, and media players. application software is contrasted with system software and middleware, which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities, but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user. a simple, if imperfect, analogy in the world of hardware would be the relationship of an electric light bulb (an application) to an electric power generation plant (a system). the power plant merely generates electricity, not itself of any real use until harnessed to an application like the electric light that performs a service that benefits the user.
