The original Starcraft was released on March 31st, 1998. With its release came a plethora of die hard Starcraft junkies that could not get enough of the game. Years later Blizzard announced they were working on a Starcraft 2. Starcraft junkies were hoping year after year Starcraft

 
2 would hit the stores shelves with no luck. Now, finally, one of the most anticipated games of all-time has been release today, July 27th, 2010... over 12 years after the initial release of the Starcraft.

The new Starcraft II was programmed with a totally new 3D graphics engine that is capable of handing visually stunning landscapes and larger armies than were possible in the original Starcraft.

VERY IMPORTANT: The original version of Starcraft may play flawlessly on your older computers. But the new Starcraft 2 will NOT play on the same old computers. With its new 3D graphics engine Starcraft 2 demands a lot faster computer with a good graphics card.
