opengl (open graphics library) is a standard specification defining a cross-language, cross-platform api for writing applications that produce 2d and 3d computer graphics. the interface consists of over 250 different function calls which can be used to draw complex three-dimensional scenes from simple primitives. opengl was developed by silicon graphics inc. (sgi) in 1992 and is widely used in cad, virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, and flight simulation. it is also used in video game, where it competes with direct3d on microsoft windows platforms (see opengl vs. direct3d). opengl is managed by the non-profit technology consortium khronos group.
