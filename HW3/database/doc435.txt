PSP go gets price cut in Japan, North America

Even the most hardened Sony fanatic would be willing to concede that the PSP go hasn¡¯t exactly prove the runaway success that many were hoping for. Regardless, the handheld is a tempting piece of kit, sporting a digital-only template without the need for pesky UMDs, and boasts a more sleeker, aesthetically pleasing design in comparison to previous incarnations of Sony¡¯s trusty slab. While talk of a PSP2 is hot topic at the moment and the impending release of the 3DS would seem to indicate the original PSP is living on borrowed time, the arrival of a price cut in all major territories will hopefully make punters wake up and smell the bargain ? after all, there¡¯s some quality offerings to be had here. In fact, this might be the ideal time to persuade some of your DS-owning mates to invest in a PSP go on the back of an attractive new price point and stellar software releases such as God of War: Ghost of Sparta and meaty back catalogue consisting of gems such as Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, God of War: Chains of Olympus, Valkyria Chronicles II, Gran Turismo and many more. Hopefully we¡¯ll see the price drop stimulate interest in the platform in the coming weeks and months leading up to the Christmas holiday season.
