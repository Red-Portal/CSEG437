3D Video Game Computer Software




I am sure that most of us enjoy playing on video games from time to time. 
  
I will never forget playing space invaders and pacman when I was a teenager, that was rather a long time ago however as I am now thirty-four years of age. 
The video games have moved on some what from those days, as has the computer software which is used to produce them. 
  
The graphics are now just immense with many utilising 3D to enhance the experience of the user. In this article I will be writing about the types of software that can be used to produce a video game. 
  
3D is of course all the rage these days and this is seemingly an essential component of any video game. Which software you choose to use will be dependent on your level on skill and expertise. 
  
For the more experienced and skilful computer user my recommendation would have to be the program called dark basic. This has been produced by a company called the game creators. 
  
For people who consider themselves to be more middle of the road, for example they are neither a novice or ultra skilful, I would recommend the reality factory. 
The added advantage of this software is the fact that it is free to download. 
  
For the less experienced computer user, my recommendation would be the games factory by click team. 
This is a very popular starting point for any wood be video game producer. 
  
Whichever option you decide to go with I am sure you will have a lot of fun learning all of the functions, perhaps even more fun than playing the games itself. It is often wiser to play 3D computer games on a console instead of a PC, consoles have firmware and architecture specifically suited to gaming. 
  
When building a PC for 3D gaming it is easy to spend seceral hundred pounds on a graphics card alone while increasing bus speeds often dictate the neccesity of new motherboards and ever increasing amounts of RAM.
