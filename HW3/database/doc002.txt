Its latest handset, however, is all cellphone. The Drift, which comes in white or black, is a tiny three-ounce phone with quite a few cool features.

The phone, made by Samsung, includes all of Helio¡¯s unique offerings, including instant messaging and the ability to use MySpace. The screen slides up to reveal the keypad. A feature called Helio on Top ? or H.O.T. ? brings a live feed of news, weather and sports scores directly to the phone.

The Drift also has a G.P.S. chip to create Buddy Beacons, letting you keep tabs on friends. Their locations appear on a United States map, and your location is on theirs. 

The Drift is available now for $225 from helio.com and many retail stores. Data and voice plans start at $65 for 500 minutes a month. After all, while Helio may not be a phone company, it still lets you make phone calls.
