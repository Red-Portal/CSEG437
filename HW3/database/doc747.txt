BuildBox

Buildbox is a 2D game development engine that allows users to build simple games without any code. 
It offers a clean user interface where you can simply drag and drop design elements to create your very own game in no time. 
This can be used for both Android and iOS platform thus, it works perfectly as a cross-platform game development engine. 
It is a bit pricey costing $99/month or $1008/year.
It is ideal for designing simple games like ColorSwitch, The Line Zen, SKY etc. 
In fact, all these games were designed using BuildBox. On the contrary, 
the engine lacks 3D capabilities and you will have constraints in implementing features which are not available in the development console. 
Whether or not to choose this toolkit largely depends on your needs. Overall it is a good solution for non-programmers to create games. 
Note that you will need a graphic designer to create design elements in most of the cases.
Kicking off a game from scratch requires high-level technical knowledge. 
Hiring a mobile game development company makes sense for every person who has limited technical knowledge to begin development on their own. 
Creating a team from scratch also drains a lot of resources which could otherwise be spent on game marketing and further improvements.
