Lumberyard

Amazon¡¯s Lumberyard is a free AAA game engine which can be used for Android, iOS, PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. 
It is based on CryEngine, a game development kit developed by Crytek. 
With cross-platform functionality, Lumberyard provides a lot of tools to create AAA quality games. 
Some of its best features include full C++ source code, networking, Audiokinetic¡¯s feature-rich sound engine, seamless integration with AWS Cloud and Twitch API. 
Its graphics are accelerated with a range of terrain, character, rendering and authoring tools which help to create photo-quality 3D environments at scale.
Amazon also acquired Twitch, a live-streaming and chatting social video platform with a user base of over 100 million users per month. 
The platform being primarily focused on video game streaming has become a critical platform for mobile and video game marketing. 
With a native integration developers can include social gaming features using Twitch ChatPlay, Twitch Metastream and TwitchJoinIn.
Pricing is another major competitive advantage of Lumberyard. 
There are no royalties or licensing fees attached to the game usage. 
The only cost associated with the tool is the necessary usage of AWS Cloud for online multiplayer games. 
But that comes with an advantage of faster development and deployment thus, proving worth the cost.
