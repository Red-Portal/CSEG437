a liquid crystal display (lcd) is a thin, flat electronic visual display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals (lcs). lcs do not emit light directly.they are used in a wide range of applications including: computer monitors, television, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, signage, etc. they are common in consumer devices such as video players, gaming devices, clocks, watches, calculators, and telephones. lcds have displaced cathode ray tube (crt) displays in most applications. they are usually more compact, lightweight, portable, less expensive, more reliable, and easier on the eyes.[citation needed] they are available in a wider range of screen sizes than crt and plasma displays, and since they do not use phosphors, they cannot suffer image burn-in.
