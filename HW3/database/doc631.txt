Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life

There's long-lasting phones, and then there's the ZenFone 3 Zoom. The Asus phone may boast dual rear cameras with an optical zoom, but its true standout feature is its long-lasting battery life. Put simply, the ZenFone 3 Zoom is the longest-lasting smartphone we've ever tested.

The runner-up, the durable Cat S41, was almost 90 minutes behind the ZenFone 3 Zoom in our testing, but it's still the only other phone we've tested recently to last longer than 15 hours on a charge. (Another phone, the ZenFone 4 Max, matched the Cat S41's time of 15:19, but this phone with a 5,000 mAh battery no longer seems to be available as Asus paves the way for its ZenFone 5 releases this year.)

Motorola makes a very strong showing on this list, too. The affordable Moto E4 Plus lasted 14 hours, 48 minutes on our battery test. While that's nearly two hours short of the ZenFone 3 Zoom's result, it's still impressive for a phone you can buy for less than $200.

Our list of the top 25 longest-lasting phones include devices that held out 11 hours or more when we test their battery by having them surf continuously over LTE until they run out of juice. You'll find everything from budget phones like the Moto G5 Plus to flagship devices from Apple (the iPhone 8 Plus), Samsung (Galaxy Note 8), Google (both Pixel phones), and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro.

Missing from that list is are Samsung's new Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+, but only just barely. The bigger of Samsung's two new phones lasted 10:59 on our battery test ? a minute shy of the 11-hour mark, but well ahead of the 9:50 average for smartphones. Curiously, last year's Galaxy S8+ outlasted its predecessor by 5 minutes, even though both phones have a 3,500 mAh battery. The S9 performed similarly, lasting 10:52; that's more than 20 minutes longer than the S8.

When testing phones, we set each phone's display to 150 nits to normalize for brightness and make sure each handset is receiving at least three bars of service.
