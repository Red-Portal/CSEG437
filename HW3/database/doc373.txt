 Make sure it's not too small. My netbook (an average model from 2008) has a keyboard that's 90% of a full-sized keyboard, which for me is a great balance between size and usability. But it's really a personal choice. It helps if you can get your hands on one to try for yourself?ask a friend with one, or visit an electronics or larger office supply store and use a demo model. Can you type on the keyboard without discomfort? How's the action of the keys? Do they feel right when you type? Are they too rigid? Too flimsy? Spend some quality time trying out different models and go with what feels best.
