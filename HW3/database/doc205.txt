HDTV resolution 
explained By David Katzmaier

Resolution is the main reason why HDTV looks so much better than standard television. 
On a high-def TV displaying a high-def source, a million or more pixels combine to create 
images that appear sharper and more realistic than TV ever has before. Resolution isn't the 
be-all and end-all of picture quality, however, and its numerous, well, numbers, can be 
incredibly intimidating at first. In this article we'll try to demystify HDTV resolution
and help you cut through the hype that surrounds all of those numbers.

How important is resolution?
Not as important as you might think. According to the Imaging Science Foundation, a group 
that consults for home-theater maufacturers and trains professional video calibrators, the 
most important aspect of picture quality is contrast ratio, the second most important is 
color saturation, and the third is color accuracy. Resolution comes in a distant fourth, 
despite being easily the most-talked-about HDTV spec today.

In other words, once you get to high-definition, most people are perfectly satisfied with 
the sharpness of the picture. All other things being equal--namely contrast and color--HDTV 
looks more or less spectacular on just about any high-def television regardless of its size 
or the HDTV signal's resolution itself. The leap from normal TV to HDTV is so big that 
additional leaps in resolution--from high-def to higher-def, let's say--are tiny by comparison.

Nonetheless the HDTV landscape is littered with resolution discussions, in regard to both 
sources and displays, so a little knowledge of how they interact is a good thing.

Native resolution: The fix is in
For the rest of this article, we'll be talking about fixed-pixel displays. A fixed-pixel 
display is any HDTV or monitor that uses pixels to produce an image, including flat-panel 
LCD and plasma screens as well as rear-projection microdisplays and front projectors that 
use DLP, LCD, or LCoS technology. We'll ignore non-fixed-pixel displays; namely, direct-view 
and rear-projection CRTs, because they treat incoming resolutions differently than their 
fixed-pixel cousins do--since they don't use discrete pixels, their specs are much more 
difficult to pin down.

All fixed-pixel displays have a native resolution spec that tells you how many pixels the 
display actually has. Native resolution is the absolute limit on the amount of detail you'll 
see.

Fixed-pixel displays follow a few basic rules:

No matter the resolution of the source material, whether VHS, DVD, or HDTV, a fixed-pixel 
display will always convert, or scale, it to fit its native resolution. 
If the incoming source has more pixels than the display's native resolution, you will lose 
some visible detail and sharpness, though often what you're left with still looks great. 
If the incoming source has fewer pixels than the native resolution, you're not getting any 
extra sharpness from the television's pixels.


HDTV source resolutions
If you read those three axioms closely, you'll see that source is everything with HDTV. Or, 
as some unknown wag once said, "Garbage in, garbage out." There are two main HD resolutions 
in use today by HD broadcasters and other sources: 1080i and 720p. One is not necessarily 
better than the other; 1080i has more lines and pixels, but 720p is a progressive-scan format 
that should deliver a smoother image that stays sharper during motion. Another format is also 
becoming better known: 1080p, which combines the superior resolution of 1080i with the 
progressive-scan smoothness of 720p. True 1080p content is extremely scarce, however, and 
none of the major networks have announced 1080p broadcasts. The term 1080p today appears 
mostly in reference to the displays' native resolution, not the source.

Source resolution name Resolution in pixels HDTV? Progressive-scan? Wide-screen? Networks/sources 
1080p 1,920x1,080 Yes Yes Yes Blu-ray and future HD-DVD players; PlayStation 3 
1080i 1,920x1,080 Yes No Yes Includes CBS, NBC, PBS, DiscoveryHD/Xbox 360 
720p 1,280x720 Yes Yes Yes ABC, Fox, ESPNHD 
480p 852x480 No Yes Yes Fox wide-screen; progressive-scan DVD players 
Regular TV Up to 480 lines No No No All 

Despite the obvious difference in pixel count, 720p and 1080i both look great. In fact, 
unless you have a very large television and excellent source material, you'll have a hard 
time telling the difference between any of the HDTV resolutions. It's especially difficult 
to tell the difference between 1080i and 1080p sources. The difference between DVD and HDTV 
should be visible on most HDTVs, but especially on smaller sets, it's not nearly as drastic 
as the difference between standard TV and HDTV.

HDTV display resolution
Now that we've considered the source, let's look at the televisions. As we mentioned above, 
all fixed-pixel HDTVs scale the incoming resolutions to fit the available pixels, throwing 
away information if they have fewer pixels and interpolating information if they have more 
pixels than the source.

Native resolution ©ö Commonly called ©÷ Meets definition of high-def? ©ø Frequency Typical TV types 
1,920x1,080 1080p Yes Rare but getting more common especially in larger TVs Flat-panel LCD; DLP, LCD, and LCoS projection; very high-end plasma 
1,366x768 768p Yes Very common in all screen sizes Flat-panel LCD; 50-inch plasma 
1,280x720 720p Yes Common in rear-projection but not flat-panels DLP, LCD, and LCoS projection 
1,024x768 HDTV plasma Yes The most common plasma resolution 37- and 42-inch plasma 
852x480 EDTV plasma No Increasingly rare 37- and 42-inch plasma 
640x480 VGA No Increasingly rare Small LCD TVs 

Technically speaking, all of these numbers are accurate and useful, but don't put too much stock
 in them. In the real world, it's difficult to tell the difference between native resolutions 
 once you get into high-def. For example, despite the fact that a 37-inch LCD with "only" 
 1,366x768 pixels has to throw away a good deal of information to display a 1080i football 
 game on CBS, you'd be hard-pressed to see more detail on a similar 37-inch LCD with 1,920x1,080 
 resolution.

The truth about 1080p
In the last couple of years, there has been a big influx of HDTVs with 1080p native resolution, 
which typically cost a good deal more than their lower-resolution counterparts. But as we've 
been saying all along, once you get to high-def, the difference between resolutions becomes 
much more difficult to appreciate. We've done side-by-side tests between two 46-inch LCD HDTVs, 
one with 1366x768 resolution and the other with 1080p resolution, using the same 1080i source 
material, and it was extremely difficult for us to see any difference. It becomes even more 
difficult at smaller screen sizes or farther seating distances--say, more than 1.5 times the 
diagonal measurement of the screen. We've reviewed a 37-inch 1080p LCD, for example, where it 
was impossible to see the separation between horizontal lines at farther than 45 inches away.

Here are a few reviews where we compared 1080p displays directly to lower-resolution models:

Sharp LC-46D62U (46-inch 1080p LCD) 
Vizio GV46L HDTV (46-inch 1366x768 LCD) 
Westinghouse LvM-47W1 (47-inch 1080p LCD) 
Samsung LN-S4096D (40-inch 1080p LCD) 
Sony KDL-40XBR2 (40-inch 1080p LCD) 
Sharp LC-37D90U (37-inch 1080p LCD) 

We're not telling you to ignore 1080p HDTVs. They technically do deliver more detail, which 
can enhance the viewing experience for more eagle-eyed viewers. Also, many manufacturers build 
other picture-quality benefits, such as better contrast and/or color, into their 1080p HDTVs 
simply because those sets are the high-end models. And given the continuing march of technology, 
we expect more and more 1080p models to become available at lower and lower prices. Today, 
however, the premium for 1080p is still pretty steep, and unless you're getting a very large 
set, say 50 inches or more, we don't recommend basing a buying decision on whether or not the 
television has 1080p native resolution.
