The ¡°Game Mode¡± destined to arrive in the Windows 10 Creators Update has been a tantalizing tease for months now, 

but now Microsoft¡¯s pulling back the curtain?somewhat?on the performance-boosting technology.

Game Mode¡¯s designed to focus your PC¡¯s resources on the game you¡¯re playing in order to increase frame rates. 

It does so by tweaking how Windows handles allocating tasks to both your processor and your graphics card, 

Xbox program manager Kevin Gammill revealed in a series of interviews.

On the graphics front, Game Mode forces Windows to grant more of your GPU¡¯s processing cycles to your game, 

rather than to background processes, Gammill told PC Gamer. The exact split will be different on every system, 

depending on the hardware and software you¡¯re running, but Gammill made a point to stress that Game Mode will definitely reduce the graphics performance of background operations.

If you¡¯re running intense Adobe Lightroom tasks in the background while you play a game with Game Mode enabled?why the hell would you do that??Lightroom¡¯s performance will suffer. 

Into watching videos while you play? Game Mode could also make, say, Netflix or YouTube chug if your GPU¡¯s being maxed out, Gammill told Rock Paper Shotgun.

Game Mode also follows in DirectX 12¡¯s footsteps by optimizing how your CPU behaves while gaming. When the feature¡¯s enabled,

 Windows will dedicate a given number of your CPU threads to the game alone, forcing all background software and processes to fight over the scraps. 

The baked-in overhead allows your game to run smoothly even if CPU demands suddenly ramp up, resulting in more consistent overall performance, Gammill told PC Gamer.
