Nintendo 3DS Specs: More Proof Smartphone Gaming is Better?

In the last year or so smartphone gaming has really kicked off, this has had an obvious effect on handhelds from Nintendo and Sony, therefore I was very keen to see what Nintendo had up their sleeves with the 3DS.
Recently the 3DS technical specs were revealed, personally I can¡¯t help but feel a little disappointed with hardware spec, especially when compared to today¡¯s high-end smartphones.
The standard Nintendo DS features two ARM processors, one of which has a core speed of 67 MHz and the other runs at 33 MHz, the 3DS has two 266MHz ARM11 CPUs which shows a huge improvement, however still lacking when compared to the 1GHz chips we see in smartphones such as the iPhone 4 and HTC Desire etc.
Obviously two 266MHz CPUs, 64MB of RAM, 4MB of VRAM and a 133MHz GPU dedicated to gaming is pretty good, especially as a smartphone¡¯s hardware has a lot of other background processes to handle, however with Qualcomm working on dual core 1.5GHz processors and other chip manufacturers working on competing chips I¡¯m worried that in a year or so the 3DS will be far inferior in terms of graphics and performance.
Nintendo has proven that there is a niche in the market for gamers who do not care about cutting-edge graphics and instead would prefer great gameplay, I understand this, but gameplay on smartphones is always improving, which could perhaps result in the 3DS becoming inferior in terms of gameplay.
We would love your feedback on this matter, do you think that the 3DS¡¯ hardware is sufficient? Or do you think that smartphones do/will offer a greater overall gaming experience?
