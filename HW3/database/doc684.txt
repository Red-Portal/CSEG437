What¡¯s the difference between GPS and GPS + Cellular?
GPS
Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS) lets you send and receive text messages, answer phone calls, and receive notifications when it¡¯s connected to your iPhone via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The built-in GPS works independently of your iPhone for distance, pace, and route mapping in workouts.

GPS + Cellular
Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + Cellular) has all the same features, as well as built-in cellular. It gives you the freedom to send and receive text messages, answer phone calls, and receive notifications even when you don¡¯t have your iPhone with you.

Cellular Carrier Support
Connecting Apple Watch to a cellular network requires the same carrier as your iPhone, and we¡¯re adding carriers all the time. If your current carrier does not support Apple Watch, cellular functionality won¡¯t work until support is provided.
