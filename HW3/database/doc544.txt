Sony to add PlayStation Plus to the Vita with tonight's update

With tonight's system software update for PlayStation Vita, Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) will be adding its premium PlayStation Plus service to PlayStation Vita in North America.  Plus members will receive six titles to play on PS Vita in addition to the dozen games currently available for the PlayStation 3 system.  Sony's premium PlayStation Network service is expanding as part of the PS Vita System Software Update (version 2.0), which will add other new features that enhance the overall gaming and entertainment experience on the PS Vita system.

Currently available for the PS3 system, PlayStation Plus offers members even more benefits with the release of Plus for the PS Vita.  Members can take advantage of the Instant Game Collection, which includes unlimited access to a regularly refreshed selection of downloadable games with an active PS Plus membership.  On day one, PS Plus members will be able to download a selection of hit PS Vita games including Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Jet Set Radio, WipEout 2048, Gravity Rush, and Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack! as well as the PlayStation Portable (PSP) hit Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions.

In addition to an Instant Game Collection, PlayStation Plus will offer members exclusive discounts on games and downloadable content, early access to betas, and automatic updates for both games and the latest system software.  PlayStation Plus also provides online storage of up to 2GB for game saves (1GB on PS3 and 1GB on PS Vita).

There are two membership options available for PS Plus, including a 3 month plan for $17.99 and a one year plan for $49.99.  PS3 owners with an existing PS Plus membership will also be able to enjoy PS Plus features and services on the PS Vita system at no additional cost.  By purchasing PS Plus for PS Vita you will be able to enjoy the benefits of PS Plus for PS3.

Outside of the addition of PlayStation Plus in the PS Vita v2.0 System Software Update, Sony is also adding a host of new features and enhancements.  These new features include the ability to check read and send email directly from PS Vita, the ability to wirelessly transfer content between PS Vita and PC in addition to browsing folders on PS3/PC and copying them to PS Vita, and allowing for PS Vita users to assign controller buttons to touchscreen, rear touch pad, and buttons with select games on the PS Vita system.

Further new features include a custom screen mode option for flexible screen size adjustment, an enchanced webb browser which now offers improved support of JavaScript and HTML 5, and the ability to "Tweet" web page addresses directly from the Vita.
