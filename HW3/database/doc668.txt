KEY INNOVATIONS
NVIDIA¢ç GPU with up to 72 custom cores - Enjoy unique mobile device innovations in photography, media, gaming, and web?including High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging, WebGL, and HTML5.
Quad-Core ARM Processor - NVIDIA Tegra 4 processor harnesses ARM's most advanced CPU cores ever, plus a second-generation battery-saver core, to deliver record levels of performance and battery life. 
The ARM Cortex-A15 CPU is the engine behind Tegra 4, while Tegra 4i is powered by the new ARM Cortex-A9 r4 CPU?which was defined by ARM with help from NVIDIA ? and the most efficient CPU core in its class.
 
Variable SMP - NVIDIA Variable SMP architecture enables four performance cores to be used for max burst, when needed, with each core independently and automatically enabled and disabled based on workload. 
The single battery-saver core handles low-power tasks like active standby, music, and video playback, and is fully transparent to the OS and applications.
Computational Photography Camera - Never miss that "once in a lifetime" shot while you turn on features like HDR, then try to hold still enough to properly capture the scene. 
The innovative new computational photography mobile architecture fuses together the processing power of the CPU, GPU, and ISP to dramatically enhance mobile imaging. 
This enables the first Always-on HDR camera with features like live HDR preview, instant HDR photos, HDR video, HDR burst, HDR Flash, and HDR Panorama, as well as the first phone-based Tap-to-Track feature.
NVIDIA i500 LTE Modem - The i500 is a full LTE modem and supports any Tegra powered device as a separate but complementary chipset. 
Tegra 4i is a single-chip processor that delivers a full application processor, and integrates an optimized version of the i500 modem.
