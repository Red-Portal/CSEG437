Razer on Wednesday unveiled its Razer Phone, a handset that clearly targets gamers. It boasts the world's first 120 Hz Ultramotion display, which has the potential to deliver fast refresh rates and provide the smoothest graphics available on a mobile smartphone.

"It's common knowledge that I'm obsessed with my smartphones. I play a ton of games on them, and they're my go-to for streaming content," said Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan.

"We have wanted to make a phone with gaming-level tech for years, and the Razer Phone delivers in every way we imagined," he said.

Sharp Display, Cinematic Sound
Powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 mobile platform, the Razer Phone features 8 GB of RAM. Its thermal design reduces throttling to maximize the handset's power and performance. It comes loaded with Google's Android Nougat but will support Android Oreo when the new OS comes out in the spring of next year. It also comes with Nova Launcher Prime with Google Assistant integration. It is selfie-ready, with dual rear 12-MB cameras.

As gamers are its target market, the Razer Phone further offers a 5.72-inch, Quad HD IGZO LCD display, as well as a front-firing Dolby Atmos technology-powered speaker with dual dedicated amplifiers. It has a THX-certified USB-C adapter with a 24-bit digital audio converter for use with audiophile-grade headphones.

The Razer Phone gets enough juice from its 4,000 mAh battery to last all day, while still providing crystal clear graphics and cinematic level audio, the company said. Further, it can enable Qualcomm Quick Charge 4+ for rapid charging so users can get back in the action.

The Razer Phone, which features the company's iconic triple-headed snake logo, is now available for pre-order at a recommended retail price of US$699.99.
