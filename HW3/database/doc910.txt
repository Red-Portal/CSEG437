PSP games that secretly run on the Vita: All you need is a PS3


The PS Vita is a pretty phenomenal piece of hardware that's technically capable of being backward-compatible with the entire PSP library. 

Alas, at this point, the list of PSP games you can download onto your PS Vita is limited. 

Sure, there are plenty of great older games (and lots of great brand-new ones, too), but there are many missing titles. Browse the list for yourself.

Sony says the list of backward-compatible games will continue to grow, but why wait? 

There are actually plenty of other PSP games you can play on your PS Vita right now, but you'll need a PS3 to make it happen.

They may not be listed on Sony's backward-compatibility list, but they certainly work.

So, here's the trick, which has been discussed on many message boards: while you can browse the PS Store to see what older downloadable PSP content is available for purchase or redownload, you're not getting the full picture of the whole PSP catalog. 

Instead, browse your download list via Transaction Management on your PSN account on the PlayStation 3, and download any PSP games. 

The PS3 will store PSP games and allow a PSP--or, a Vita--to sync the content.
