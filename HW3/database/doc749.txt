New Huawei smartphone features Goodix in-display fingerprint sensor

Goodix has announced that its optical in-display fingerprint sensor is featured in the “PORSCHE DESIGN HUAWEI” Mate RS flagship smartphone, which also features a flexible display.

The in-display fingerprint sensor supports both flexible and rigid OLED displays while maintaining performance and reliability, the only sensor in the market which does so, according to Goodix. The company says it has worked with partners to perfect the lamination technique for flexible displays.


 
The Huawei P20 and P20 Pro will also feature Goodix fingerprint sensors, and the companies have a longstanding partnership.

“The era of bezel-free smartphones has arrived, it is imperative to offer differentiating values through innovative products to excel in competitions,” the company declares in the announcement. It also says that a total of over 350 million Android phones have now been shipped with its fingerprint sensors.

The Vivo X21 was also recently unveiled with a Goodix in-display fingerprint sensor, as the market for biometric unlocking technology on premium smartphones turns away from capacitive sensors. Synaptics in-display fingerprint sensor is also integrated in Vivo smartphones.
