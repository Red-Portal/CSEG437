If you enjoyed the original Monument Valley, you need to grab its sequel right away. 

And if you've never played the puzzle game, Monument Valley 2 is a great way to get started: it's a standalone game that doesn't require you to have played the original. 

The mentally stimulating puzzles are back, this time with a touch of color and light as you navigate through a kingdom that resembles an M.C. Esher print. 

Monument Valley 2 adds welcome new features like the ability to control a second character the heroine Ro is joined by her child on this journey while maintaining the minimalist look and immersive music that made the first game such a joy to play.
