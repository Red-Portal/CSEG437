My Tamagotchi Forever is one of the newer AR games out now. 

It's actually just a modernized version of the old Tamagotchi toys from the 1990's. 

You raise a little pet, play with it, feed it, and take care of it. The game also offers various customizations and other stuff. 

The AR elements in this game aren't part of the core experience. It lets you explore a town in AR. 

We imagine that many mobile games will use methods like this in the future where only select parts of the game use augmented reality. 

This one is a freemium game, but people seem to like it anyway.
