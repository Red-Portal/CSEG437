PlayerUnknown¡¯s Battlegrounds makes the lead to mobile in a very satisfying port for Android users. 

If you¡¯re familiar with the console or PC version in which 100 players fight it out battle royale-style to see who¡¯s the last one standing, PUBG Mobile delivers more of the same on your Android phone or tablet. 

Smartly, the mobile version adapts its controls and game mechanics such as looting to make them friendlier for touchscreen devices. 

And updates have added new arcade modes along with an entirely different desert-based battleground to explore, keeping things fresh.
