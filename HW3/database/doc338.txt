T-Mobile getting in on the netbook game with the Dell Mini 10?

There's no arguing the popularity of netbooks ? which is why some carriers have been so eager in offering them in their lineups. Not only does it provide a great solution for customers looking for a mobile computer that constantly has connection to the internet just about anywhere, but wireless carriers are making huge profits thanks to the data plan that's required with them. Now T-Mobile may finally be joining the fun with the Dell Mini 10 ready to hit stores flaunting the AWS band; according to one of TmoNew's sources. Previously it was heard that some kind of Dell product was headed over to T-Mobile ? then it was rumored that it would be the Android powered Dell Mini 5. In actuality, it now appears to be none other than the new Dell Mini 10 netbook unveiled during CES. T-Mobile will probably start rolling out this netbook sometime towards the end of March ? unfortunately pricing for this netbook is still in the dark.
