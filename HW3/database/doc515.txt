The Apple App Store is a digital application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple Inc. The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with the iOS SDK published through Apple Inc.
Depending on the application, they are available either for free or at a cost. The applications can be downloaded directly to an iOS device, or downloaded onto a personal computer (PC) or Macintosh via iTunes. iOS Application Development is the process of creating small software applications for iPhone devices. These applications are generally targeted on a particular hardware attribute of the device like the motion games are based on the motion sensors of the device, online video calling is based on front camera and lot more. iOS application development is attracting the developers as well as the business for PPC[disambiguation needed] and brand awareness. 30 percent of revenue from the store goes to Apple, and 70 percent goes to the producer of the app[2] (minus an annual USD$99.00 development fee to Apple).[3]
