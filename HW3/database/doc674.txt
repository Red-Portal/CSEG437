Apps are the new model of application software that originally developed for the software distribution to
mobile devices, is emerging also in the other categories of devices. User finds the apps in a custom website
called the store, whereas apps in the form of an auto-installing software package can be downloaded freely or
after paying a fee, and easily installed and configured. The mobile platform environment shows a plethora of
systems considering the large number of mobile hardware and software manufactures. The apps regardless of the
type of category they belong (i.e., social, educational, games), are distinguished in native, web or hybrid apps
depending on the tools and technologies used to develop. The paper analyzes mobile operating systems from a
software developer perspective focusing on cross-platforms tools in order to propose actual and future platforms
where to deploy apps. The work is part of a research aimed at designing and developing apps for science
outreach and education. The selection of mobile platforms target influences the tools needed to develop apps.
Cross-platforms development tools allow greater distribution to different platforms, but have some limitations
and cannot be the only methodology adopted. The choice of mobile development framework depends both on the
type of the app and the mobile platform.
