There's been plenty of iPhone drama this week, but none of it has to do with the big conference--WWDC--Apple's putting on 
next week, or even last week's Samsung court case. Nope. Apple is drawing praise -- and much more fire -- for apps. Plus, 
two juicy rumors about future iPhone screens and a third camera. Here's what happened this week. Three cameras, OLED for 
all Dual cameras, schmual cameras -- how about three? A new analyst report speculates that the 2019 iPhone will have one 
telephoto lens and two more to create a depth map for AR. Those three iPhones rumored for 2019 are
 also suspected to all use OLED screens, just like the iPhone X. This screen technology is known for producing rich color 
with high contrast and deep blacks. Who would've thought that a doodling app could bring bitter iPhone and Android fanboy 
rivals together? Just A Line is a multiplayer "game" at the heart of Google's first Android-to-iOS AR experiment. 
Anyone with Android or iOS can collaborate on AR doodles in the same environment. Apps, bringing the world closer together 
since 1987.Unfortunately, apps don't always mend relationships; sometimes they tear them apart. Telegram, an instant-messaging
app now banned in Russia, says that Apple is keeping it from updating its iOS app. Telegram was prohibited on Russian 
territory after its founders refused to provide users' private communications to Russian security agencies. 
In a recent statement, co-founder Pavel Durov implied that Apple was siding with Russia on this dispute over user privacy.
Let's hope we get to the bottom of this. And in another serious breakup: gamers might feel the heartbreak now that Apple 
allegedly rejected an app that would have let you stream PC games to your iPhone or iPad. Apple had initially agreed to 
release Valve's Steam Link app, but like all ended relationships, promises don't always pan out.
