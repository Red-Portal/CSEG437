wifi technology builds on ieee 802.11 standards. the ieee develops and publishes some these standards, but does not test equipment for compliance with them. the non-profit wifi alliance formed in 1999 to fill this void to establish and enforce standards for interoperability and backward compatibility, and to promote wireless local-area-network technology. as of 2010[update] the wifi alliance consisted of more than 375 companies from around the world. manufacturers with membership in the wifi alliance, whose products pass the certification process, gain the right to mark those products with the wifi logo.
