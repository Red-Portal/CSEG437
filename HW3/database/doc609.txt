What is the difference between "phone memory" and "internal storage" in an Android phone?
 Phone storage is an embedded memory in phone and this is the memory part that is allowed to the user to access it. 
Your additional apps are installed in this memory and can be seen when it is connected with PC. Also it stores pictures, music and videos.
