PPSSPP 1.4 is the latest stable and most advanced release of the free and cross-platform PSP (PlayStation Portable) emulator application, 
available now for GNU/Linux, Android, and Microsoft Windows platforms.

Last year in September, PPSSPP 1.3 launched with numerous goodies, including the ability to record games,
 support for Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphones and Apple devices running iOS 9 or later,
 initial support for the Vulkan API on Windows, as well as better support for 64-bit Android TV systems and Raspberry Pi SBCs.

Now PPSSPP 1.4 is here with Direct3D 11 support, 
which appears to offer a boost in many PSP games over OpenGL or Direct3D 9, on most hardware. 
Along with this implementation, the development team also managed to add support for post-processing shaders in Direct3D 11.

HiDPI and audio improvements, Prescale UV setting removed
The PPSSPP 1.4 release doesn't appear to be a major one, but it adds a bunch of improvements for the audio quality, 
specifically for linear interpolation, HiDPI (High Dots Per Inch) displays,
 as well as for Bluetooth headsets via a new audio setting that improves the compatibility with the latest devices.

There's also hardware bezier/spline tessellation added in the Vulkan, OpenGL, 
and Direct3D 11 support, better compatibility with various gamepads, 
a workaround for a font-related mipmap issue in the Japanese version of the Tactics Ogre game,
 missing font files for the Android build, and UMD switching improvements for some multi-UMD games.

Last but not least, PPSSPP 1.4 removes the Prescale UV setting to improve perf, and brings various other minor compatibility fixes, 
under-the-hood performance improvements, and code cleanups. You can download PPSSPP 1.4 for GNU/Linux, 
Android and Microsoft Windows operating systems right now from our website or from the official homepage of the project.
