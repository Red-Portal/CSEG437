Applications Processors – The Heart of the Smartphone

I’ve written recently about the major components inside today’s smartphones, including smartphone power systems and the limits to how thin a smartphones can be.

This post is about the applications processor, or APU. 

The term APU arose to identify the chips in smartphones that could run an operating system and applications software. 

These capabilities made them more comparable to computers than early cell phones. 

While earlier cell phones also contained a processor, it was a baseband processor tasked only with handling the digital processing related to the actual communication over the cellphone radios.

State-of-the-art APUs in today’s smartphones are the pinnacle of the system-on-chip (“SoC”) movement that began in the nineties. 

Integration has always been central to the microelectronics business. 

Combining the various functionality offered in multiple discrete integrated circuits became a natural evolution that would reduce component count and circuit board complexity leading to a system cost reduction 

– good for consumers and handset maker profit margins alike.

Nowadays, it is standard for your iPhone to be powered by an Apple A6 APU integrating multiple ARM cores along with several graphics processing units (GPU), 

large on-chip cache memories, memory controllers for communicating with off-chip DRAM, audio and video decoders (and encoders), USB host controllers, and other analog circuit functions.

It’s not just Apple. 

Every smartphone is powered by one of a number of ARM (or similar but proprietary) microprocessor core-based chips offering quad-core processors and multi-core GPUs.
