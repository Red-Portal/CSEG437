The PS3 uses the Cell microprocessor, which is made up of one 3.2 GHz PowerPC-based 
"Power Processing Element" (PPE) and six accessible Synergistic Processing Elements (SPEs). 
A seventh runs in a special mode and is dedicated to aspects of the OS and security, 
and an eighth is a spare to improve production yields. PlayStation 3's Cell CPU achieves 
a theoretical maximum of 230.4 GFLOPS in single precision floating point operations and 
up to 15 GFLOPS double precision.

The PS3 has 256 MB of Rambus XDR DRAM, clocked at CPU die speed. 
The PPE has 64 KB L1 cache and 512 KB L2 cache, while the SPEs have 2 MB local memory (256 KB per SPE), 
connected by the Element Interconnect Bus (EIB) with up to 307.2 GB/s bandwidth.
