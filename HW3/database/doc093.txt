	Transfer Pictures: From a Digital Camera to a Computer
			  [Windows PC - USB]

The method used to transfer pictures to the computer is different, depending upon
which digital camera you are using. Newer models have USB capabilities, which are
much simpler than using Card Readers for the Memory Cards that digital cameras use.
For cameras such as the 3.2 Megapixel Nikon Coolpix [model 3100] or the 4.0 Megapixel
Nikon Coolpix [model 4300], a USB cord is provided to transfer pictures from the
camera to a computer.

1. After you have taken all the pictures you wish to take, or have filled the Memory
Card, take the camera to any available Windows PC in the Lab. Locate the USB
cord in the camera¡¯s carrying case.

2. Make sure your camera is turned off. Plug the smaller end of the USB cord into
the camera, and the larger into an open USB port on the PC.

3. Turn the camera on.

4. Double-click the My Computer icon on the desktop of the computer and locate
the temporary drive that shows up.

5. Double click the DCIM folder within the temporary drive to find your pictures.
Click and drag the pictures to the desktop of the computer to burn them to a
disc, save them, or send them by email. You may also delete your pictures from
the camera at this time by dragging the pictures in the DCIM folder to the trash.

6. When you are finished, simply turn the camera off, and then disconnect the USB
cord.
