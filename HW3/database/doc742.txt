Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) is the next version of UDK (Unreal Development Kit). 
It is brand new engine released by Epic Games. 
This game development kit comes with immense options for mobile, PC as well as console game development. 
UE4 encompasses stunning graphical capabilities like advanced dynamic lighting 
and a new particle system that can handle up to a million particles in a scene simultaneously. 
This is a definite treat for any 3D game developer.
The new Unreal Engine 4 comes with many changes from its predecessor. 
Unlike UDK, Unreal Engine 4 uses C++ as the scripting language, completely replacing the popular UnrealScript. 
Also, the Kismet is replaced with a more user-friendly Blueprint system. 
Because of these changes, even experienced game designers will go through a learning curve to master the updated version.
There is also a change in pricing from $19/mo to a 5% royalty whenever the game is shipped. 
This royalty will only apply if the earnings per game are more than $3000 per quarter. 
These changes have made Unreal Engine 4 free for many developers which would likely increase market penetration of the tool. 
Apart from Android and iOS, it can also be used for PC, Mac, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 game development. 
It also comes with tools to leverage virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for mobile game development. 
The versatility and capabilities of this tool can help you develop stunning games of any size 
and quality making it an ideal choice for many mobile game developers.
