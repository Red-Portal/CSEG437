Console Wars 2017: Will Sony or Microsoft Win?


Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have been battling each other in the gaming industry for 16 years. 

Gaming is far more important to the livelihood of Sony than Microsoft, and therefore the stakes are much higher for Sony.

The console war between Sony's PlayStation (PS) and Microsoft's Xbox has grown more heated with time. 

The first round was no contest. Sony's PS2 -- launched in 2000 -- outsold the original Xbox by more than 100 million units. 

In the next cycle, the PS3 barely edged out the Xbox 360. 

So far in the current cycle, Sony's PS4 has dominated, selling over 50 million units compared to Microsoft Xbox One's 28 million.

But Microsoft is planning a major counterattack

Things started going Microsoft's way in 2016, when Xbox One began to outsell PS4. 

To a degree, this may stem from some games receiving higher ratings on Xbox One than PS4.

However, Microsoft's momentum was halted in its tracks in the fall when Sony released two new versions of its console -- the PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro.

The Slim is cheaper than the launch version and is more compact, while the PS4 Pro features enhanced processing power in order to display games in 4K resolution.

The console landscape will change again later this year when Microsoft launches a new console codenamed "Scorpio." 

Reports show Scorpio's technology to be far superior to PS4 Pro. 

A developer for some Microsoft exclusive games has even claimed that Scorpio is not an intermediate upgrade like Sony's console and instead Scorpio is taking a much bigger leap and is a full-blown, next-generation console.
