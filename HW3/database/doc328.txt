
A few weeks after purging thousands of adult-themed 
iPhone and iPod touch applications from its App Store, 
Apple is again cleaning house, this time yanking 
a series of apps developed to identify WiFi hotspots. 

According to 3 Jacks Software, developer of the 
WiFi-Where application, Apple lowered the boom on 
Wednesday: "We received a very unfortunate email 
today from Apple stating that WiFi-Where has been 
removed from sale on the App Store for using private 
frameworks to access wireless information," the firm 
states on its blog. "It also appears that all other 
competing WiFi enabled apps have been removed as well."

Softpedia reports that the developers behind the rival 
WiFiFoFum and yFy apps confirmed that Apple removed 
their software. While the computing giant has not yet 
commented on its decision, it appears that the company 
is targeting only applications that scan for nearby WiFi 
access, not those that enable users to search for hotspots 
based on database information and their GPS-specific location.
