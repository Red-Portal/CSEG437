Cocos2D-x

As the name suggests Cocos2D-x is a 2D game development kit for Android, iOS, Linux, OS X and Blackberry mobile phones. 
Being an open-source tool, it comes with loads of detailed documentation and community support. 
It is highly resource efficient in the sense that you can create games of a size as low as 1.5 MB. 
It uses OpenGL to render optimized 2D graphics.
This platform has evolved dramatically over the past few years and has become a preferred choice many developers around the world. 
Some of the popular games developed using Cocos2D-x include Badland, Clash of Kings, Hardest Game Ever 2, Contra: Evolution etc. 
It free pricing and library of existing resources make it a good competitor for 2D game development. 
Though it is a very effective tool it has limited capabilities in 3D game development. 
Apart from this, it is a superb game development SDK for a small to mid-size project.
