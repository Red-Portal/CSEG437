Why Virtual Reality Games Will Be a Technological Revolution

Earlier this month I attended the Worlds Fair Nano in New York City. 

It was a festival devoted to the future of technology. 
The idea was lofty, and the festival¡¯s talks and exhibits were were more tangential toward than supportive of that idea. But in the midst of social media discussions and drone demonstrations, I saw potential for a real innovation: a video game controller.

That controller is the one in the photo above. 

It¡¯s a lightweight plastic gun that¡¯s an exact replica of the one in the zombie game on the bottom left of the screen. 

The controller is made by Ilium VR, a startup that makes realistic controllers exclusively for virtual reality consoles, like the HTC Vive headset pictured above. 

This controller is an exact replica of the rifle in the demo zombie game in the display. 

It was the most popular exhibit at the event, with lines of people waiting 15 minutes to waste zombies for 60 seconds

Virtual reality games have yet to catch on, but they¡¯re getting there. 

Headsets like the Sega VR and Nintendo¡¯s Virtual Boy have been around since the late 1980s, but the technology is finally coming into its own thanks to the Oculus Rift. 

The Rift is the result of an incredibly successful 2012 Kickstarter campaign. 

The technology allows gamers to move through immersive virtual environments like Tuscan villas, Arctic wilderness, and roller coasters. 

Those games were so successful that they inspired licensed virtual games like Alien: Isolation and Minecraft. They also inspired more virtual reality headsets like the HTC Vive, the Playstation VR, the VirtuSphere, and even the discontinued Google Cardboard.
