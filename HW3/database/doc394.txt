geforce is a brand of graphics processing units (gpus) designed by nvidia. as of 2009[update], there have been eleven iterations of the design. the first geforce products were discrete gpus designed for use on add-on graphic boards, intended for the high-margin pc gaming market. later diversification of the product-line covered all tiers of the pc graphics market, from cost-sensitive (proof) motherboard-integrated gpus to mainstream add-in retail-boards. most recently, geforce technology has been introduced into nvidia's line of embedded application processor, designed for electronic handhelds and mobile handsets. with respect to discrete gpus, found in add-in graphics-boards, nvidia's geforce and ati's radeon gpus are the only remaining competitors in the high-end market. with the recent announcement of larrabee, intel has stated its intention to (eventually) compete in the same high-end gpu market as amd and nvidia. along with its nearest competitor, the amd (ati) radeon, the geforce architecture is moving toward gpgpu (general purpose-graphics processor unit). gpgpu is expected to expand gpu functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3d graphics, to turn it into a high-performance computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a cpu does.
