Flash games may be the epitome of wasting time, but there¡¯s no denying their appeal when you have five minutes to spare and a thirst for something more than a cursory glance at Twitter or Facebook. They¡¯ve come a long way from their humble, vector-based beginnings, finding a home at websites like Newgrounds, Kongregate, and Addicting Games among other popular sites, while becoming increasingly more complex and fully-featured. Whereas many early flash games were browser-based recreations of classic titles like Pac-Man and Frogger, the market new heights with the introduction of high-speed Internet and hit titles like Bowman, The Impossible Quiz, and Max Dirt Bike. It¡¯ll be years before they could offer the in-depth storyline, cutting-edge graphics, or sheer scope of today¡¯s blockbuster console titles, but there¡¯s no reason browser-based alternatives can¡¯t hold you over between meetings or during those drab hours of the day. No one wants to spend $60, anyway.
