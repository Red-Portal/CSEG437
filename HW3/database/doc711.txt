Forget AirPower, meet Ortek's Wireless Charging Receiver for AirPods
The AirPods add-on lets you charge your AirPods case on any Qi charging pad.

With Apple's AirPower still very much missing in action, those looking to wirelessly charge their AirPods can look to Ortek's aptly named Wireless Charging Receiver for AirPods APR-100.

Resembling the old iPhone docks, the APR-100 plugs into the AirPods case's Lightning port and acts as a receiver for Qi charging. It does increase the size of the AirPod case by a bit, which may not be as aesthetically appealing.

The $30 Ortek dock will come with safety features, such as a thermal shutdown and over-current protection, so you won't accidentally melt your $159 AirPods. It will take about 1.5 hours to fully charge the case (as well as your AirPods). You will be able to get it worldwide through distributors soon.
