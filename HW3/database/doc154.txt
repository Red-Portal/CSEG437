 Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communications technology. Devices with Bluetooth capabilities can beam (exchange information) over a distance of about 10 meters (30 feet) without requiring a physical connection. Unlike infrared, you don't need to line up the devices to beam information with Bluetooth. You can even beam information to a device in a different room, as long as it's within range. 

You can use Bluetooth as follows:  
 Beam information, such as files, appointments, tasks, and contact cards, between devices that have Bluetooth capabilities.
Create a connection between your device and a Bluetooth phone to use the phone as a modem. 
Use a Bluetooth service. Once you connect to another device or computer using Bluetooth, you can locate and use any of the services available on that device.  
 
 Tip
Your device might include additional Bluetooth features. For more information, see the documentation included with your device.
